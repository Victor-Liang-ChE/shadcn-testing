This project is a web application featuring a collection of interactive tools and simulations primarily focused on Chemical Engineering principles. It includes calculators for stoichiometry, thermodynamics, process dynamics, and visualizations for concepts like McCabe-Thiele diagrams, residue curve maps, and molecular structures.

## About This Project

This repository hosts a Next.js application designed to:

- Provide interactive tools for common chemical engineering calculations.
- Offer visualizations for complex thermodynamic and separation processes.
- Serve as an educational resource for students and professionals in chemical engineering.
- Explore the application of web technologies to create engineering tools.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
